Exercise 1

When to use Reference vs Pointer?

Use Reference:
Object must exist
Never change what it refers to.

Use Pointer:
Object may be optional (can be null)
Can change what it points to.

Can reference be null?
NO, reference must always refer to a valid object.

Can reference be reassigned?
NO, once reference is set to object it can only refer to that object.

Syntax Differences?

Reference:
void func_ref(int &ref);
func_ref(var);

Pointer:
void func_ptr(int *ptr);
func_ptr(&var);

Also have to dereference in pointer function.


Exercise 2

When are stack objects destroyed?
Automatically destroyed when they go out of scope.

When are heap objects destroyed?
Must be manually destroyed using delete.

What happens if you forget to delete a heap object?
Memory leak occurs, memory remains allocated until program ends.

Why is stack allocation faster than heap allocation?
Stack allocation is faster because it simply involves moving the stack pointer, while heap allocation requires searching (more work).

When to use stack vs heap allocation?
Use stack for small, short-lived objects.
Use heap for large objects or objects that need to persist beyond the scope they were created in.
